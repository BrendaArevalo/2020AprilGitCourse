# notes for lesson 1

# course intro
- up-front honesty: there's going to be some rough edges
    + we planned to do a course maybe later in the year
    + rushed to put this together right now
    + I'm about 2 weeks ahead in lessons, which affects how I order things
- Zoom logistics; question moderator
- information on GitHub, questions on Slack
- the course is really fluid
    + before the class, request specific content/topics (give me lead time!)
    + that goes for pace, too; kind of worried the pace is too aggressive
- today's meetings = what I imagine, but it could change

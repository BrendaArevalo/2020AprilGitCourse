Hello,

I've added you to the participant list for "â€‹Source Control Using Git and GitHub".  Later this week I'll be sending out a longer email with all the course details.  I'll also send out a questionnaire asking about your background with git and GitHub.  More importantly, it'll also contain a poll for deciding what day and time the Zoom meetings will take place.

This is a form email, but feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions you have!


Don

Hello all,

Welcome to "Source Control Using Git and GitHub"!  This email contains information about the course, including some useful links and the things you should do before the first assignment.  But first, some background...


Course outline & philosophy

I (Don Olbris) will be running the course.  I've been with Janelia SciComp since 2006, and I've been using git and GitHub since about 2013.  I'm an experienced user, but I'm not a git power user.  I just want to get normal stuff done safely and easily.  I'll also be helped by other members of SciComp.

The course is a mix of Udemy and SciComp material.  We rely on Udemy to provide the core git and GitHub lessons, while we in SciComp will focus more on practical matters that help you get things done in the real world.  The SciComp part of the course is meant to be very flexible in what we cover; if participants have specific questions or topics they want covered, we will do our best to work them in.  Send me feedback via email or Slack!


What to expect & schedule 

Each week, I'll send out an assignment of about 2 hours of Udemy videos.  There are no formal exercises that go with the course; you should instead follow along and do the operations with the videos.  This will probably add on another hour or so of time to the videos--more if things don't go well.

Toward the second half of the week, we'll hold the interactive Zoom class.  We'll decide the day and time in the initial course questionnaire (see below).  Each meeting, we'll start with a summary of the week's videos, with time for comments from us and questions from you.  Note that this is a short summary!  We will *not* be repeating most of the information in the videos.  You need to watch them yourselves!  After the summary, we'll have one or more short lectures from SciComp on various git-related topics that aren't covered by the Udemy videos.  At the end, we'll have more time for open Q&A, or some demos on our part, or maybe even some entirely optional material.  The exact contents will be guided by participant feedback.

The day and time for the weekly meetings will be determined based on feedback from participants (see link for questionnaire below).  It's probably going to be impossible to find a time that everyone can make.  However, we do plan to record the meetings, and together with the on-demand video and Slack help, you may find it worthwhile to do the course even if you can't make the Zoom meetings when they happen live.

In between class meetings, we'll keep in touch using Slack, a text communication tool (see link below).  I'll post class info there (and email it), and you can ask questions and get help there.  If you've already used Slack at HHMI, you should be able to join the workspace and channel immediately.  If you haven't, you should open a ticket with Tech Support asking that you be given access to Slack (they have to set you up in Okta).


Your homework

Your homework for this week (before the course officially begins) is:

* enroll in the Udemy course: https://hhmi.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-masterclass/
* fill out the initial questionnaire by Monday, April 24 at noon (anonymous, please only fill out once): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK_dFDkWLVoJZLvLA_bUuiAGJNyJ_y3iJe_65l68eqGdWWdg/viewform?usp=sf_link
* be sure you can access the Slack workspace and channel
    - contact Tech Support if you've never used Slack at Janelia
    - join this workspace: https://janelia-dev.slack.com
    - click the "+" button by "Channels"; choose "Browse channels"
    - join the #april-2020-git-course channel

If you want to get started on the first week's work, it'll cover sections 1 and 2 of the Udemy course.  These two sections will help you install git and sign up for GitHub.  The assignment will be officially emailed Friday afternoon.  The full (evolving) curriculum is linked from the course's GitHub page: https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/2020AprilGitCourse


If you have any problems, the Slack channel is the best way to ask them.  But you should feel free to email me as well.


Don
